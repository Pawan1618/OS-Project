# os project 
1. Project Overview
Goals
Develop a real-time visualization tool to track memory allocation.
Simulate paging and segmentation memory management techniques.
Provide an interactive GUI to monitor memory usage dynamically.
Expected Outcomes
A working tool that displays memory allocation and deallocation in real-time.
Ability to toggle between paging and segmentation views.
Efficient simulation of memory fragmentation and process execution.
Scope
Core Scope: Visualization of memory allocation in real-time.
Extended Scope (if time permits): Integration with an OS simulator or real process tracking.
2. Module-Wise Breakdown
The project can be divided into three key modules:

1. Memory Simulation Engine
Simulates memory allocation, paging, and segmentation.
Handles process creation, execution, and termination.
Maintains memory tables (Page Tables, Segment Tables).
2. GUI for Visualization
Displays real-time memory allocation.
Allows toggling between paging and segmentation views.
Uses color coding to differentiate process memory blocks.
3. Data Logging & Analysis
Logs memory allocation/deallocation events.
Provides insights like fragmentation percentage, memory usage trends.
3. Functionalities
Memory Simulation Engine
✅ Paging Mode

Divides memory into fixed-size pages.
Maintains page tables for each process.
Displays page allocation in frames.
✅ Segmentation Mode

Divides memory into variable-sized segments.
Uses segment tables for mapping.
Simulates external fragmentation.
✅ Process Management

Creates and removes processes dynamically.
Allocates and frees memory in real-time.
GUI for Visualization
✅ Memory Representation

Grid-based memory view for paging.
Block-based memory view for segmentation.
✅ User Interaction

Toggle between paging and segmentation views.
Highlight specific processes in memory.
✅ Color Coding

Different colors for used, free, and fragmented memory.
Data Logging & Analysis
✅ Logging

Logs memory allocation events with timestamps.
✅ Analytics

Displays memory usage statistics.
Graphs fragmentation over time.
